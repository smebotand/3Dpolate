1;Buckle up, let's get started &#128513<br><br>You automatically start in the <b>QC LABDATA</b> page. <br> This is were you will check the status for your data before proceeding with analyses. <br>Let's find some data!
2;At NGI we love and organize everything according to our <i>Project Numbers</i> and so does <b>MiljøData</b> too &#10084&#10084&#10084<br><br>Now type in e.g. <b>20170853</b> as <i>project Number</i>!
3;Then push <b>Search</b> to retrieve data. <br><br>Automatically a number of tests are alo performed in the background to identify <i>data quality issues</i> (this takes aprox. 5 seconds, stay tuned &#128551). 
4;The <b>QC LABDATA</b> page page consiste of several diferent tabs, each made to serve one specific purpose!<br><br>NB: Within the <b>QC Labdata</b> page a sample might be listed twice (i.e. duplicates) if e.g. someone sent two samples with the same <i>Sample ID</i> to lab or if lab has transfered the data twice due to reanalysis etc.
5;In the first tab <b>Project Overview</b> we get the overall status for our <i>selected project number</i>! Hmm... are all the <i>Sample ID's</i> correct, any duplicates here etc?<br><br>For tips and tricks on how to resolve issues always push the small <b>?</b> along the way for guidance!
6;Now, click the last tab <b>Browse Labdata Database</b>.<br><br>Here you can explore all samples registered in the database! <b>However</b>, samples from <b>X-projects</b> are rejected, as NGI Digital cannot currently restrict availablity of data to specific users. 
7;Please click <b>Edit Thresholds</b>.<br><br>When you are happy with your dataset you can go ahead with analyses and exports! You can e.g. start to defining unique <b>Thresholds</b> for classification of some polluted soil you recently found etc?
8;Remember, that everything in <b>MiljøData</b> is attached to a <i>Project Number</i>, thus the available <i>Thresholds version</i> you see here are stored on the <i>Project Number</i> you have chosen above, the same goes for the edits you make in the <b>Create Datareport</b> page as well.<br/><br/> NB: You can never edit a version stored in the database, due to tracebility requirements. But, you should be fine as you are able to load previous versions, make your edits and then store as a new version &#128521 
9;Please click <b>Analyze Data</b> to view the actual dataset (at last)!<br><br>Now something automagic has happen, several samples might have disappeared! &#128565 When you analyse your data we have <i>behind the scenes</i> filtered your dataset for duplicates, only the newest parameter value for each Sample ID is shown. Don't worry or be confused, just assure your <i>Project Numbers</i> and <i>Sample ID's</i> are correct and everything will run smoothly!
10;By the way, you can allways jump between different pages using these <i>navigation buttons</i>, your edits are even kept as you move around! However, if you change the <b>Project Number</b> everything is reloaded from the database and unsaved changes are lost.<br><br><b>That's it, Now Go Explore </b>&#128526
