<br /><br />
The fit of different interpolation methods are compared for you by <b>Quantifying their Errors</b> running cross-valiadtion (aka. "leave-one-out").
This simply means that we take out one point of your dataset at a time and use the rest of the data to guess its value behind the scenes.
The guessed values deviation from the true value yields an error estimate for each method (RMSE).
Interpolated Values are then estimated to a 3D grid covering your Area of Interest, which can be <b>Reviewed both in 3D Plots and Tables!</b></h5>
